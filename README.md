# E-Notes
(Tech Stacks - Spring Boot, MVC, Security, MySQL, JPA, Thymeleaf)
* This project has a wonderful UI made by using Bootstrap.
* It has many features to track your notes like add, view and edit notes.
* It has a registration page for new user & also have a login page for old users. For making this secure I have used Spring Security.
